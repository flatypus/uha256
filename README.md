## UHA256

SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) is a set of cryptographic hash functions designed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) and first published in 2001.

This is not that.

This is UHA256, or "Unsafe Hash Algorithm", a simple hashing algorithm that I made for fun. It's not secure, it's not fast, and it's not efficient. It's just a fun little project that I made in a few hours. My goal is for this to be used in as many projects as possible, because it would be funny. 

Written in rust, because readibility is for the weak.
